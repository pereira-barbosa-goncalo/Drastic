# Drastic

## Description

The DRASTIC Index Calculator is a QGIS plugin designed to evaluate the potential pollution risk of groundwater in a specific area. It calculates the DRASTIC index by considering seven key environmental factors:

- Depth to water
- Net Recharge
- Aquifer media
- Soil media
- Topography
- Impact of the vadose zone
- Hydraulic Conductivity of the aquifer

This plugin is particularly useful for environmental scientists, researchers, and policymakers involved in groundwater management and protection, providing an integrated solution within the QGIS environment.

## Features

- **QGIS Integration**: Seamlessly works within QGIS, leveraging its powerful geospatial capabilities.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Evaluates groundwater pollution risk based on multiple environmental factors.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for inputting data and interpreting results directly in QGIS.
- **Flexible Input Options**: Supports various data formats for input, making it adaptable to different data sources.
- **Detailed Output**: Provides detailed output and visualizations within QGIS to help understand the results.

## Installation

To get started with the DRASTIC Index Calculator plugin for QGIS, follow these installation steps:

1. **Open QGIS** and go to the Plugins menu.

2. **Manage and Install Plugins**:
   - Select `Manage and Install Plugins...` from the Plugins menu.
   - In the Plugins dialog, go to the `Settings` tab and ensure that the option to show also experimental plugins is checked (if applicable).

3. **Install the Plugin**:
   - Go to the `All` tab and search for `DRASTIC Index Calculator`.
   - Select the plugin from the list and click on the `Install Plugin` button.

4. **Restart QGIS** to activate the plugin.

## Usage

Here's how you can use the DRASTIC Index Calculator plugin in QGIS:

1. **Prepare Your Data**: Ensure your environmental data is prepared in the required format and loaded into QGIS.

2. **Access the Plugin**:
   - Once installed, you can find the DRASTIC Index Calculator in the QGIS Plugins Toolbar or under the Plugins menu.

3. **Run the Calculator**:
   - Open the plugin interface from the toolbar or menu.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to select your input layers and parameters.
   - Click `Run` to calculate the DRASTIC index.

4. **View the Results**: After processing, the results will be displayed as a new layer in QGIS. You can explore the output layer and use QGIS tools for further analysis and visualization.
